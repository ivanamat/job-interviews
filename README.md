# Job Interviews 
Here you can find different exercises that I have done during job interviews, I hope you enjoy them.

## Java
* [Egg Dropper](https://github.com/ivanamat/job-interviews/tree/master/Java/EggDropper): Suppose that you had n eggs in a n floor skyscraper, and you wanted to conduct an experiment to find out the highest floor (​critical floor​) from which you could drop an egg without breaking it...

## NodeJS
* [API REST](https://github.com/ivanamat/job-interviews/tree/master/NodeJS/nodejs-api-users): This is an example of REST API developed with Swagger using MySQL as persistent data storage. This API manage users. You can Create, Read, Update and Delete users.
